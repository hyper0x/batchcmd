batchcmd
==========

A Helper for executing system command.

# Usage

1. `go get github.com/hyper0x/batchcmd` .

2. Run & fun:
```bash
batchcmd -c=<command> 
```
I often use it with `-c="git pull"` for pulling the updated content from git repo. 
You can type 'batchcmd --help' to discover more usages.
